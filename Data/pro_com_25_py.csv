And if I could I
Would look at us all the time

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

"I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow","And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Verse 2
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
We're singin' in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all

Chorus
'Caus there we ar again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Verse 3
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the teeball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down Any time now
He's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Chorus
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well yeah

Bridge
Well maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpledup piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all all all
Verse 4
They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened you
That's what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willin' you to come
And he said It's supposed to be fun turning twentyone

Verse 5
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well yeah

Chorus
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

Verse 6
And I was never good at tellin' jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Outro
Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there Oh
Down the stairs I was there I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it All too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there"

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done"

And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out

Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then take me back to when

We found weekend jobs when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

Chorus
And I'm on my way I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
